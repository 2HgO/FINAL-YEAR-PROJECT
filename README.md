# FINAL-YEAR-PROJECT
A Speech Activated Control System for Infrared Appliances

                                  ABSTRACT

Infrared control is a technology that has been around for over half a century and
involves the use of infrared signals, naked to the human eye, to transmit control code to
appliances. It has applications in several areas of the world to control heavy or small
machinery and appliances.

Speech recognition refers to the process by which language patterns can be inferred
and interpreted from a given audio signal. This process is used in a wide variety of
applications in modern day â€“ from complex IoT systems to simple dictation
applications. The popularity of IoT over the last two decades has made operating
numerous devices from a central location easier and more seamless. However earlier
infrared controlled appliances cannot benefit from this technology as they do not
possess an interface to connect to the network which is necessary for IoT.

The major objective of this project is to provide support for earlier infrared appliances
so they can benefit from current speech recognition technology. This is done by
implementing a central control system which can receive and process commands in the
form of speech inputs as well as transmit infrared signals for device control.
